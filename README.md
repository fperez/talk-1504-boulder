# Materials for talk @ NCAR's SEA conference

These are the PDF slides and notebooks used for [my talk](https://sea.ucar.edu/event/project-jupyter-language-independent-architecture-open-computing-and-data-science) at the NCAR [SEA'15](https://sea.ucar.edu/conference/2015) conference and at the NREL computational sciences semianr.  See abstract below.

This directory contains the following files:

* A [PDF](ProjectJupyter.pdf) of the main slides.

* A set of interactive demos as Jupyter Notebooks:
  - [Index](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/fperez/talk-1504-boulder/blob/master/Index.ipynb)
  - [Quick Tour of the Notebook](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/fperez/talk-1504-boulder/blob/master/QuickTour.ipynb)
  - [IPython: a polyglot kernel](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/fperez/talk-1504-boulder/blob/master/Multiple%20languages%20from%20inside%20IPython.ipynb)
  - [A Julia Notebook, with interactive widgets](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/fperez/talk-1504-boulder/blob/master/Julia-Interactive%20Widgets.ipynb)
  - [An R notebook](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/fperez/talk-1504-boulder/blob/master/ggplot2-examples.ipynb)


**Note:** to run some of these notebooks, you'll need to install a fair amount of dependencies that may not be part of your everyday workflow. They are meant to be a demonstration of lots of capabilities in rapid succession, so they have an unusally high number of dependencies.

# Abstract

**IPython & Project Jupyter: a language-independent architecture for open
computing and data science.**


IPython began its life in Boulder in 2001, as an environment for
interactive scientific computing and data analysis, motivated by my
needs as a physics graduate student. Over the years, it evolved into
one of the main elements of the collaboratively developed ecosystem of
open source tools for science in Python.

In recent years, IPython has evolved into Project Jupyter: an
architecture that takes the foundations of IPython and extends them to
any programming language. Jupyter offers interactive terminals as well
as a popular web-based notebook environment. In the Jupyter Notebook,
users can create documents that combine computation, results and
narrative, including mathematical typesetting, figures, multimedia and
interactive controls.  These documents can be shared online, converted
to other output formats (HTML, PDF, etc), and used as a tool for
reproducible research and education.
